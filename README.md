# Mixed Message Portfolio Project
                        
This is a project about a fortune telling message generator, in which every time a user runs the program, they will get a new randomized fortune message. I built this project because it is part of my full stack engineering course in Codecademy to demonstrate my knowledge in JavaScript, Git and GitHub.

## How to use

It is a simple program, the user just have to run the program and it will automatically generate a fortune message.

## Technologies

-JavaScript.
-Git.
-VS Code.
-Command Line.

## Message template

Your sign right now is: _fortune sign_.
It means: _meaning of the sign_.
My personal advice for you is: _fortuner's personal advice_.
